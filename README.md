In my recent analysis of an investment survey dataset, I uncovered some intriguing insights that could help shape investment strategies and provide targeted financial advice.

🤔 Questions Explored:
1️⃣ What is the most common mode of investment across different age groups?
2️⃣ What resources are used based on age groups?
3️⃣ What percentage of investors use each resource for their investments?
4️⃣ What is the distribution of investment goals across all investors?

🎯 Problem Statement:
Investment patterns vary across different demographics, and understanding the factors that influence investors’ decisions is crucial for providing targeted financial advice and improving investment strategies. The survey data contains information about investors’ age, gender, income, resources used, motivations, and investment goals, presenting an opportunity to analyze key trends. This analysis aims to uncover insights such as the most common modes of investment, resource usage by different age groups, distribution of investment goals, and the resources investors rely on the most.

🔧 Tools Used:
Power BI: Stacked Column Chart, Stacked Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Slicer, and Card.
Power Query: Data transformation, cleaning, and preparation.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation:
To ensure accurate analysis, I focused on data cleaning and transformation:

🔄 Changed data types of relevant columns to ensure proper analysis.
✏️ Renamed headers for clarity.
🗑️ Removed empty columns to streamline the dataset.
🔢 Added index numbers for easy referencing.
🎂 Created a conditional column for age grouping (e.g., 18–24, 25–34, etc.).
➕ Added new measures to perform specific analyses, such as counting resources and calculating percentages.

📊 Investment Survey Insights Dashboard Summary:

1️⃣ What is the most common mode of investment across different age groups?
Using the “Mode of Investment by Age Group” chart, I found that the 18–24 age group has the highest count of distinct investment modes, with employed individuals forming the majority.
As age increases, the number of distinct investment modes decreases, indicating that younger investors tend to diversify their investments more than older age groups.

2️⃣ What resources are used based on age groups?
There are no significant differences in resource usage among age groups in analyzing resources like books, brokers, and mobile apps; they all utilize a balanced mix of traditional and modern resources.
This suggests that investment tools, whether traditional or digital, are equally relevant across different age demographics.

3️⃣ What is the distribution of investment goals across all investors?
The “Total Investors by Investment Goals” pie chart revealed that wealth generation is the most common goal (28%), followed by personal savings (22%) and retirement planning (20%). This emphasizes the importance of long-term financial planning among investors.

4️⃣ What percentage of investors use each resource for their investments?
Visualized through the “Total Investors by Resources Used” donut chart, family members are the primary resource, representing 48% of the total.
mobile applications follow at 26%, highlighting the growing influence of digital tools in investment decisions.

💡 Recommendations:
Mode of Investment Across Age Groups: Offer investment options matching each age group's preference.
Resources Used by Age Groups: Provide online resources for younger investors while maintaining traditional materials for older investors.
Distribution of Investment Goals: Adjust financial advice to meet the common investment goals of different clients.
Percentage of Investors Using Each Resource: Encourage family discussions about investments and promote mobile apps and news articles for informed decision-making.
